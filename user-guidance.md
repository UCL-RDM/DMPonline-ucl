Version 0.1 May 2017 **DRAFT**

DMPOnline is an online tool produced by the Digital Curation Centre to help researchers create Data Management Plans. 
The tool offers templates and guidance to meet the Data Management Plan requirements of a range of funders and institutions. Plans produced in DMPOnline can be customised and exported to a variety of formats. It is possible to share your plans with other people. Draft plans will be saved and it is possible to create multiple plans if required. 

## Sign-in or create account 
If you have not previously used DMPOnline you will need to create an account. Once you have created an account you can create link it to your UCL institutional credentials and login using your institutional credentials.

Once you have chosen your funder you can choose your institution. This will allow you to see guidance created for UCL researchers.

You will also have the option to check the box to view DCC guidance. It is recommended to choose to view DCC guidance as UCL guidance is intended as a supplement to this guidance rather than a replacement.

Once you have completed these basic questions you can start answering the questions required by you funder/template by clicking on ‘answer questions’ or choosing the appropriate tab. You will now see a list of questions required by your funder. Clicking on the question will open a text box where you can fill in your answer.

On the side of the text box you will find additional guidance to help you answer these questions. This includes ‘generic’ guidance from the Digital Curation Centre, funder requirements and UCL guidance where relevant.
